Doxygen

*Author: Kerren Ortlepp*

This is a quick tutorial on how to use Doxygen, it's really simple and
shouldn't take too long to set up!

Firstly I'm using Code::Blocks 12.11 , if you don't already have it -
GET IT :) !! It's got a plugin called DoxyBlocks which handles Doxygen
for you!



Okay so here are the steps to follow to get everything sorted!:

1. Download and install Doxygen from here.
2. Download and install Code::Blocks 12.11 (if you haven't already got
   it), if you don't have MinGW then download the Code::Blocks(mingw)
   setup, otherwise just get the standard Code::Blocks binary and
   it'll find where you installed MinGW from last time :)!! If you
   don't know what I'm talking about when I say "MinGW" then you
   should probably take the first option cheeky!
3. Start a new project in Code::Blocks and write your code.

Hear is my header file::

  FILE MISSING

Here is my cpp file::

  FILE MISSING

4. To explain a function hit, control-alt-b just before the start of
   the function and add your explanation.
5. Anytime you need to comment a single line use control-alt-l instead
   of \\.
6. Go to the DoxyBlocks option in the menu bar in Code::Blocks and
   click DoxyWizard, or hit control-alt-D.

This is what the wizard looks like:

7. Now erase /doxygen from the working directory so that the doxygen
   directory is the same as your code directory.

8. Go to the run tab and click "Run doxygen".

9. Click "Show HTML output"

All done :)!!! Here the link is to the above project files so you can
check them out if you need too :)!!

Also if you're trying to figure out all of the different functions in
Doxygen like \param, \brief, \file, etc, here is a good link!

I hope this helps!

Feel free to post questions in the sakai forum on this!
